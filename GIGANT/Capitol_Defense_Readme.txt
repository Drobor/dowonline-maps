Compatible with DoW Dark Crusade and Soulstorm

Fluff:


The planet Lilyan, beautiful and prosperous, houses 8 untarnished relics believed to have been cast in the same holy foundry as the Emperor's Golden Throne.  A revered site for pious pilgrims and wealthy interstellar tourists alike, these Relics provided a large source of revenue for the locals.  Stiff taxes on all profits across the planet were exacted, though, to ensure the ongoing safety of these most valuable treasures.  But now for almost a decade the corrupt governor Scams and his bureaucratic lackies have secretly horded wealth by maintaining a far smaller and badly equipped planetary defense guard than their reports showed.  

Somehow information of the Relic's vulnerability got into enemy hands, perhaps sold by Scams himself who with 13 of his closest advisors vanished without a trace the day before the attack came.  The home guard was powerless to stop the massive enemy onslaught and in one swift and deadly assault the entire Capitol city was overrun.  Very few civilians survived to be evacuated, fitting with Scams plans to leave no witnesses to his misdeeds.  Communication transmissions to nearby planets and Imperial Outposts were jammed, preventing any appeals for help to be made.  But as the murderous hordes neared the center of the city, old Mr. Benignant, chief custodian of the Relics, managed to send an urgent plea for help through Psyker to Psyker Translentelia.  

As fortune would have it, your command ship Legend was passing nearby and your psychic navigator received the communication.  After loosing several precious minutes making sure he wasn't just crazy, you realize that within minutes the Relics will be captured and profaned.  In the face of all odds you and your band of heroic allies must attempt the rescue of the Relics! Believing they have won the battle, the enemy only sends in basic reconnaissance forces at the start.  But beware, when your resistance is detected expect much stronger attacks until the full force of the assulting army decends upon you!  Failure will at least grant you a place in the hall of famed martyrs, and in the slim chance of success you will have renown across the galaxy!  


Installation:


To install this scenario, extract the zip archive into your DXP2 folder and it may say something like this: “The folder already contains a floder named Data.  If the files in the existing folder have the same names they will be replaced.  Continue?”  You must answer “Yes to All”.  Along with this map is the documentation for EZScar and the latest version of the EZScar script.  You are welcome to use and-or modify in part or in whole the Capitol_Defense.scar script for your own map or mod and do not need to ask for any specific permission.  Please do mention, though, that you are using EZScar and keep its header intact. 

Game Setup:

It is very important to use FIXED STARTING POSITIONS and PLAYERS SET TEAMS.  You can leave any of slots 3 to 5 closed if you like, but you may find it easier to play with computer allies instead of on your own.  Player2 must be set to be on team2 and will be the race you choose to be the enemy.  All other players should be set as your allies on team one.  It can be played as a single player, or as an online/LAN co-op.  Player 2 is designed to be run by the computer but actually does work if one human player wants to direct the attacks.  He gets no extra requisition and rarely can take points, but does get lots and lots of troops...

The only objectives this scenario is designed for are ANNIHILATE or DESTROY HQ.  Anything else may cause malfunctioning.

All the standard races should work as either enemies or defenders.  New Race Mods should be able to play as defenders, but not enemies.  Defenders of new races will not have a commander unit talking to old Mr. Benignant at the start of the game.

Easy, Standard, Hard, Harder and Insane grant the same number of buildings to the enemy player but will affect the number and strength of his units.  

Starting Resources should be set to “Standard” instead of “Quick Start” to avoid giving extra resources to the enemy.  Every defender receives a generous allotment of Power and Requisition from the Capitol Treasuries at the very start.

Squad Cap increases.  Population and vehicle caps are greatly increased as this is a full scale battle, not a typical skirmish.  Unless you use a mod that permits it, you will still be held to the same number of Relic and special units, only your standard units will be able to take advantage of the high caps.

Known Issues:

1.  There is not a lot of space inside and around the Capitol Building.  Having fewer allies will give you space but you really man need them!  Use the space wisely and you should do all right, keeping research buildings towards the center and unit production ones outside.

2.  The Capitol building blocks vision.  As beautiful as it is, the Capitol building is not a relic and is expendable, if you so desire.  To destroy it Player 1 simply needs to delete old Mr. Benignant or send him to die at the hands of the enemy and the walls will crumble (sorry, no animation!)  It will not give you any more room inside, but greatly helps with visibility.

3.  This can get really laggy!  This scenario is of a massive onslaught and involves large numbers of units.  It takes a top notch computer to run it in high resolution.  If you experience lags, there are several things you can do:  
   1.  DO NOT use “Heroes” as this takes lots of extra processing power
   1.  Lower the number of AI allies (leave one or more slots “closed”), 
   2.  Lower the resolution settings on your computer, 
   3.  If a mod affects the computer AI, use “Highspeed” if it is an option 
   4.  Make sure your computer is not running other processes that slow it down
          (virus scan, quick launch programs, etc.)

4.  This is not very easy even on Easy!  Well, it is a desperate battle and be happy you took down as many enemies as you did.  Look in Tips and Tricks for some hints that may help you out next time around!  The upper levels are very hard and make a good playground for Imbalance mods (for example, The Super Servitor, Imperial Guard Veterans, Adeptus Imperium, Tau Mini Mod, No Limits Mod, etc).  If you use one like this then Easy is a lot easier.

5.  The actual game starts during the opening camera sweep and voice intro sequence:  I had the option of making this completely non-interactive, but do do so means you would have to watch it every time before a multiplayer game would start and that gets boring fast!  The way it is now once you have seen the camera sweep and have an idea of your surroundings, just press <Esc> and you will have full control of your camera again.   You still will hear old Mr. Benignant rambling on abd sorry for not making a better voice - you might be able to guess it's a young fella faking it rather than a genuine codger!  Don't worry if you want to see the whole intro sweep since you are given a bit of extra time for this sequence and if you stop it early you will just have a bit more of an advantage.  This way multiplayer is not upset if different players stop the intro event at different times.  

Tips and Tricks: 

(Caution, contains spoilers! Adventurous players can just get started, but if you become disgruntled with the map or are of the more cautions type this may be of help to you.)
 
This scenario is best played with several human players that can think – AI players will only help a little bit.  The attacks come in 4 waves, often from four directions at the same time.  The wave of attackers will not stop until the buildings are destroyed of that wave.  To win you have to plan both defense and offense, prepare wisely!  You can have some players focus solely on defense while another goes for the attack, or all use your lesser units to defend but prepare stronger units (Terminators, Dreadnoughts, Baneblade, etc.) for a simultaneous attack.  

Focus on destroying the buildings that the troops come from.  Any structure other than a generator or turret is likely to be “producing” troops, meaning that the spawn from it while it continues to exist.  They are in collections and you must destroy all the buildings in that location for them to completely stop producing. Destroying half only means that the troops will spawn faster from the remaining ones, there will still be the same number.  When the last building is destroyed for that location, then all the troops that spawned from those buildings will instantly die.

Conserve your Resources: It might work to just spam a lot of low level troops if you are on Easy, but on the higher levels you will find that you run out of resources and there is no easy replacement.  Even with resources on “High” the relics and few strategic points don't produce a lot.  The best bet is to use your offense wisely to avoid taking massive numbers of casualties.  Be careful with high cost items like “Earth Shaker Rounds” that consume lots of resources.
